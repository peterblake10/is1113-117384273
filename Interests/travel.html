	    <h1>Most Travelled to Place</h1>
	    <p>
	        The place I have visited the most is Fuerteventura. I have been to Fuerteventura 4 times with my family. We visited in 2012 and had no hesitation in coming back.<br>
	        The main attraction is the main beach. It is ranked as one of the best beaches in the world and is approximately 7 kilometres long. The weather in Fuerteventura is perfect during the summer months, ranging between 22 and 28 degrees.<br>
	        The main town is stretched along the coast and is home to a number of beautiful restaurants. The locals are very friendly and the views from the coast are in a different class.

	    <h1>Favourite Place</h1>
	    <p>
	        My favourite place to visit is Rome. I was in there in 2015 with my family for a week. I was taken aback by the beautiful architecture all over the city. No matter where I looked there was another impressive building.<br>
	        We visited all the main attractions like the Colosseum and the Vatican and they were just as good as expected if not better.<br>
	        Although the temperatures and prices were a bit too high, I hope to visit Rome again some day.

	    <h1>Where I Most Want To Visit</h1>
	    <p>
	        The place I most want to visit is America. I have always been fascinated by America, seeing it so frequently on television. Every state almost seems like a new country and that diversity is intriuging to me.<br>
	        There are so many places in America that I would love to visit such as New York, Boston and California. I hope to get the chance to undertake my third year work placement in the states and I could also see myself living there in the future.
