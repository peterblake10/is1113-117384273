	    <h1>Favourite Sport: Soccer</h1>
	    <p>
	        I have played soccer with my local club Bandon since 2003. I started by playing with the school of excellence on a Saturday morning and have played through all the age levels. <br>
	        At Under-15 level, we came runners-up in the Neil Welch Cup and followed it up by winning the U-16 league title. In that same year i was named the Player of The Year. I am currently playing with the Junior team and my position is right-back. <br>
	        When I'm not playing soccer, I'm watching it on television. Every weekend revolves around The Premier League and I usually watch any match that is live on TV.

	    <h1>Favourite Team: Chelsea</h1>
	    <p>
	        I've supported Chelsea since i was 4 years old. My earliest memory is Chelsea winning back-to-back league titles in 2005 and 2006. My idols growing up in that era would have been the likes of John Terry, Frank Lampard, <br>
	        Didier Drogba and Petr Cech. I've been to one Chelsea match back in 2008, unfortunately ending in a 0-0 draw with Hull City, but I hope to visit Stamford Bridge again in the near future. <br>
	        My favourite memory of being a Chelsea fan is without doubt our Champions League win in 2012, beating Bayern Munich in their own stadium on penalties.

	    <h1>Favourtie Player: Eden Hazard</h1>
	    <p>
	        Eden Hazard signed for Chelsea in the summer of 2012. Now in his 6th season at the club, Hazard has become one of the worlds best players. His ability to glide passed defenders makes him an absolute joy to watch.<br>
	        When he gets on the ball, the whole stadium is brought to their feet in anticipation of something special. Hazard is a model professional. Despite recieving many kicks and fouls every match, he keeps picking himself up and fighting for the team. <br>
	        I hope to one day get the opportunity to watch Hazard playing in the flesh.
