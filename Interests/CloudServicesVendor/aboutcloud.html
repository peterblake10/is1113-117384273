         <h2>Software As A Service (SaaS) - Salesforce</h2>
         
         <p>
             

Software as a service (or SaaS; pronounced /sæs/) is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet—as a service. SaaS applications are sometimes 
called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers.

Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. The provider manages 
access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.

         <h2>Communication As A Service (CaaS) - Gmail</h2>
         
         <p>
             Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise 
             communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor.
             Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet
             telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and 
             videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. 
             CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service 
             (SaaS).
             CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and 
             medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for
             the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. The
             network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to 
             day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand
             and resources are not wasted. There is no risk of the system 
             becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or 
             replacement.
