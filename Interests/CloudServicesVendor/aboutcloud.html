         <h2>Software As A Service (SaaS) - Salesforce</h2>
         
         <p>
             Software as a service is a way of delivering 
             centrally hosted applications over the Internet as a service. 
             SaaS applications are sometimes called web-based software, 
             on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, 
             SaaS applications run on a SaaS providers servers.
Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the 
Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. 
The provider manages access to the application, including security, 
availability, and performance. SaaS business applications are usually 
accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.

         <h2>Platform As A Sevice (PaaS) - Cloud9</h2>
         
         <p>
             Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in 
             which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software 
             tools, usually those needed for application development, 
             to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware
             and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees 
             users from having to install in-house hardware and software to 
             develop or run a new application.The principal benefit of PaaS is
             simplicity and convenience for users -- the PaaS provider supplies
             much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can 
             access anywhere via a web browser. PaaS providers then charge for
             that access on a per-use basis -- a model that many enterprises 
             prefer, as it eliminates the capital expenses they traditionally 
             have for on-premises hardware and software. Some PaaS providers
             charge a flat monthly fee to access their service, as well as the
             apps hosted within it.

         <h2>Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) - Amazon Web Services</h2>
         
         <p>
             Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing 
             infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet.
             Quickly scale up and down with demand, and pay only for what
             you use.

IaaS helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your
own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is 
offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a 
particular one for as long as you need it. The cloud computing service 
provider manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure,
and manage your own software operating systems, middleware, and applications.

         <h2>Communication As A Service (CaaS) - Gmail</h2>
         
         <p>
             Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise 
             communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor.
             Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet
             telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and 
             videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. 
             CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service 
             (SaaS).
             CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and 
             medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for
             the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. The
             network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to 
             day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand
             and resources are not wasted. There is no risk of the system 
             becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or 
             replacement.
